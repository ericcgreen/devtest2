# devtest2

## Approach Taken

To replicate a web app based off a photo, I used a number of methods and tools to get a close as I possibly can. First, I after doing a wireframe and determining what features I needed to deliver for MVP, I began to code. I initially started to set up a bootstrap development environment. Upon determining that I didn't need to do this and to save more time, I changed my method to use the bootstrap CDN instead. That was not only quicker, but respected the storage space and file size of my final product. Using the CDN, I had access to the bootstrap library. I used HTML, LESS/CSS, and JQuery/Javascript to build this app. I used Node to install and watch LESS. I used Font Awesome for the social icons, DesignApp.io to make the "Darth for Galactic Overlord" logo, http://star-wars-ipsum.herokuapp.com/ to generate star wars themed lorem ipsum paragraphs, Digital Color Meter tool to extract the colors from the task photo, and I found the background image of Darth Vader online after doing some research and stumbling upon one of WEC's projects.

## Issues

Some issues I had were testing for both IE-9 backwards compatibility and Retina-readiness. My machine does not allow me to perform these task. I've included some methods to address this, but I would like to ask more questions about this, if given the opportunity to meet in-person.
